# Media-Blog
First website dedicated to blogging about different types of media.

February 21, 2026: Dived deeper into containers and beginning to learn about flexbox. Finally created a navigation bar and readjusted my footer. Made some styling edits to the body of the home page to give it a more organized and unique look. 

To-Dos: 
    - Organize CSS syntax for better readability and flow.
    - Write rough draft for event schedule and about section. 
    - Adjust the links container so the box model does not take up so much space. 
    - Create a new html page and link it to one of the navigation bar links. 
    - Find a color palette theme for the website.
